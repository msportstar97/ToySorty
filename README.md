# ToySorty
A VR sorting game with toy figures modeled after Big Hero 6's microbots. A group of 5 teamed up to create this fun interactive game for not just kids, but also adults. This game puts the players in a toy room setting, decorated with many toy figures with a nice back window view of mountains. There are a total of 4 different levels, each with one little extra piece of the toy figure they need to take apart. Each part of the toys will have different ways to take them apart (i.e. swinging the toy around to take off the head). There are also power-ups (i.e. increase time) that players could grab to help them beat a level. Tutorials with videos are provided to assist players.
